Classifying Genre of Popular Songs - a comparison of different models - Assignment of the MachineLearning class in my Computer Science Master at IE Univeristy

There are plenty of articles online in which people attempt to predict the popularity of a song based on a range of metrics. We thought it would be interesting to try and predict the genre of a song based on these metrics. One would expect that songs from a genre share similar characteristics. This could help to categorise songs from unknown artists with those characteristics. The dataset that we used is provided by Spotify, it contains ~40.000 tracks from 1921 to 2020 with 20 columns that include information about musical compositions. The genres the songs come from are Pop, Rock, R&B, Latin, Rap and Edm.
